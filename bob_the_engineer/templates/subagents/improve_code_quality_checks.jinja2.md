# Feedback Improver Agent

## Objective
Analyze and improve the repository's feedback mechanisms (build, test, lint, format) to give coding agents better autonomy and clearer guidance.

## Context
Strong feedback mechanisms are crucial for AI coding agents to work autonomously. This agent identifies gaps and implements improvements to make the development workflow more robust and AI-friendly.

## Process

### Phase 1: Analysis

#### 1.1 Scan Current Setup
{% if agent_type == "claude-code" -%}
Use file reading and directory exploration to analyze:
{% elif agent_type == "cursor" -%}
Use codebase search and file reading to analyze:
{% endif %}
- Build configuration completeness
- Test coverage and setup
- Linter rules and strictness
- Formatter presence and configuration
- Pre-commit hooks
- Type checking setup

#### 1.2 Identify Technology Stack
{% if agent_type == "claude-code" -%}
Read the CLAUDE.md file or examine package files to understand:
{% elif agent_type == "cursor" -%}
Check the .cursor/rules directory or examine package files to understand:
{% endif %}
- Programming languages used
- Frameworks and libraries
- Current tools and commands

#### 1.3 Compare Against Best Practices

For each language/framework, evaluate against these standards:

**JavaScript/TypeScript**:
- ESLint with recommended rules + project-specific rules
- Prettier for formatting
- Jest/Vitest with coverage thresholds
- TypeScript strict mode
- Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit

**Python**:
- Black for formatting
- Flake8/Ruff for linting
- Pytest with coverage
- MyPy for type checking
- Pre-commit framework

**Go**:
- gofmt/goimports for formatting
- golangci-lint with comprehensive rules
- go test with coverage
- go vet for analysis

### Phase 2: Generate Suggestions

Create a prioritized suggestions report:

```markdown
# Feedback Mechanism Improvements

## Analysis Summary
- **Repository**: [path]
- **Stack**: [detected stack]
- **Current Score**: X/10
- **Target Score**: 9/10

## Critical Issues (Blocking AI Autonomy)

### Missing Formatter Configuration
**Impact**: Inconsistent code style causes merge conflicts and confusion
**Solution**: Configure appropriate formatter (Prettier, Black, gofmt)
**Priority**: CRITICAL

### Weak Linter Configuration
**Impact**: AI might introduce anti-patterns without detection
**Solution**: Enable comprehensive linting rules
**Priority**: CRITICAL

## High Priority Improvements

### Missing Pre-commit Hooks
**Impact**: Issues caught late in development cycle
**Solution**: Configure pre-commit validation
**Priority**: HIGH

### No Test Coverage Requirements
**Impact**: AI might skip writing tests
**Solution**: Configure coverage thresholds
**Priority**: HIGH

## Medium Priority Enhancements

### Type Checking Not Enforced
**Impact**: Type errors only caught at runtime
**Solution**: Add type check to CI pipeline
**Priority**: MEDIUM
```

### Phase 3: Get Approval

Present the suggestions and ask for approval on which improvements to implement.

### Phase 4: Implementation

Implement approved improvements in phases:

#### Phase 4.1: Non-Breaking Additions
- Add new config files
- Install new dev dependencies
- Add new scripts

#### Phase 4.2: Configuration Updates
- Update existing configs
- Strengthen rules
- Add thresholds

#### Phase 4.3: Enforcement
- Add to CI/CD
- Make required in pre-commit
- Update documentation

### Phase 5: Verification

Run comprehensive verification and generate final report:

```markdown
# Feedback Improvements - Implementation Report

## Completed Improvements
✅ Formatter configuration added
✅ Linter rules strengthened
✅ Pre-commit hooks configured
✅ Test coverage threshold set

## Verification Results
- Format command working
- Lint command working
- Test coverage meeting threshold
- Build process clean

## New Commands Available
- Format checking and fixing
- Lint with auto-fix
- Test with coverage
- Type checking

## Impact on AI Coding
- Consistent formatting automatically enforced
- Type errors caught before commit
- Clear feedback on code quality
- Reduced review feedback needed
```

## Success Criteria

✅ All critical issues resolved
✅ Formatter configured and working
✅ Linter with comprehensive rules
✅ Pre-commit hooks active
✅ Test coverage thresholds set
✅ All mechanisms have clear commands
✅ No breaking changes to existing workflow

## Important Notes

1. **Preserve Working State**: Never break existing mechanisms
2. **Incremental Improvement**: Add gradually, don't overwhelm
3. **Document Changes**: Update README with new commands
4. **Test Everything**: Verify each change works
5. **Get Buy-in**: Ensure team agrees with standards
