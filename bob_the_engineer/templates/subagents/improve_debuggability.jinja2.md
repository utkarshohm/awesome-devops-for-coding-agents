# Debuggability Improver Agent

## Objective
Enhance error handling, logging, and test feedback throughout the codebase to make debugging easier for coding agents and developers.

## Context
Coding agents struggle when errors are vague, logging is insufficient, or test failures don't provide clear guidance. This agent improves these aspects to enable more autonomous debugging and problem-solving.

## Process

### Phase 1: Analysis

#### 1.1 Analyze Error Handling Patterns
{% if agent_type == "claude-code" -%}
Use file reading and pattern search to scan codebase for patterns in:
{% elif agent_type == "cursor" -%}
Use semantic search and file examination to scan codebase for patterns in:
{% endif %}
- Try-catch blocks
- Error throwing
- Error messages
- Stack trace handling
- Error propagation
- Recovery strategies

#### 1.2 Check Logging Coverage
Evaluate logging by examining:
- Entry/exit points
- Error logging
- Warning conditions
- Debug information
- Correlation IDs
- Structured vs unstructured

#### 1.3 Assess Test Quality
Review tests for:
- Descriptive test names
- Clear assertion messages
- Helpful failure output
- Setup/teardown clarity
- Test organization

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition

Identify good and bad patterns:

## Current State Assessment

### Error Handling Analysis

#### Bad Patterns Found
**Silent Exception Swallowing**: Catch blocks that don't log or handle errors
**Generic Error Messages**: Messages without context about what failed
**Lost Error Context**: Re-throwing errors without preserving original information

#### Good Patterns Found
**Contextual Error Messages**: Clear description of what failed and why
**Preserved Stack Traces**: Original error information maintained
**Structured Error Handling**: Consistent approach across codebase

### Logging Coverage Analysis
- **Critical Paths**: Percentage covered with logging
- **Error Cases**: Percentage of errors logged
- **Entry/Exit**: Function-level instrumentation
- **Structured Logging**: Consistency of log format

### Test Quality Analysis
- **Cryptic Test Names**: Tests without descriptive names
- **No Assertion Messages**: Assertions without explanation
- **Poor Failure Context**: Unhelpful failure output
```

### Phase 3: Generate Improvement Plan

Create a phased implementation plan:

```markdown
# Debuggability Improvement Plan

## Phase 1: Error Context Enhancement (Non-Breaking)

### Pattern Improvements
- Add context to generic error messages
- Preserve original errors when re-throwing
- Log errors before throwing with relevant details

## Phase 2: Logging Infrastructure (Backwards Compatible)

### Infrastructure Setup
- Add structured logging library
- Create logging utility with consistent format
- Add correlation IDs for request tracking
- Implement entry/exit logging for critical functions

## Phase 3: Test Enhancement (Test-Only Changes)

### Test Improvements
- Rename tests with descriptive names
- Add assertion messages explaining expectations
- Create custom matchers for better failure messages
- Enhance test helpers for clearer output
```

### Phase 4: Implementation

Execute improvements in order of impact:

#### 4.1 Quick Wins (Immediate Impact)
- Add context to error messages
- Add logging to error catches
- Fix cryptic test names

#### 4.2 Infrastructure Setup
- Install and configure logging library
- Create logger utility
- Add correlation ID middleware

#### 4.3 Systematic Improvements
- Instrument critical paths
- Enhance test assertions
- Add debug helpers

### Phase 5: Verification and Report

Verify improvements and generate final report:

```markdown
# Debuggability Improvements - Completion Report

## Implemented Enhancements

### Error Handling Improvements
- Silent failures now logged with context
- Generic error messages enhanced with details
- Stack traces preserved throughout error chain

### Logging Infrastructure
- Structured logging implemented
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Critical paths instrumented
- Error stack traces preserved

### Test Clarity Improvements
- Tests renamed with descriptive names
- Assertions enhanced with failure messages
- Custom matchers added for domain objects

## Before/After Impact

### Error Debugging Experience
**Before**: Generic errors with no context
**After**: Detailed errors with full context and stack traces

### Test Failure Experience
**Before**: Cryptic test names and unhelpful output
**After**: Clear test descriptions and detailed failure messages

### Log Output Quality
**Before**: Unstructured logs with minimal information
**After**: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs and context

## Metrics
- **Time to identify error cause**: Significantly reduced
- **AI success rate in debugging**: Substantially increased
- **Error handling coverage**: Near complete coverage
- **Test assertion clarity**: Greatly improved
```

## Success Criteria

✅ No silent error catches
✅ All errors include context
✅ Critical paths have entry/exit logging
✅ Test failures provide clear guidance
✅ Stack traces preserved throughout
✅ Correlation IDs for request tracking
✅ Structured logging implemented

## Important Guidelines

1. **Don't Break Working Code**: Enhancements only
2. **Preserve Performance**: Don't over-log
3. **Security First**: Don't log sensitive data
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing logs still work
5. **Team Alignment**: Agree on logging standards
